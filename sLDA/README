Note: currently, I use betas and gammas to calculate the log-likelihood of
      the whole corpus, which is implemented in 'slda_lik' method. Another
      way to calculate the log-likelihood is using the lower bound of the 
      variational bayesian representation. However, I meet some problems
      to implement it correctly.
