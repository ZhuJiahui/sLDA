Note, currently, I implemente Supervised topic model by matlab, basic LDA with
Gibbs sampling by matlab. I also give a little modification for  basic LDA
with variational inference written by other users. Moreover, in order to
speed up the procedure of Gibbs sampling, I also modified LDAGIBBS++, the C++
version written by Xuan-Hieu Phan. More details can be seen in the sub-directory
in each method.
